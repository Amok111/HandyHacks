THIS IS FOR INSTRUCTIONAL AND EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY! This
has nothing to do with hacking anything in the cyber crime sense.
What this is more akin to would be something like "Life Hacks".
It is a group of handy utils and shortcuts I made into a handy
little script because...I'm lazy like that. I get tired of
typing the same crap over and over, so yeah. Now you too can
enjoy being lazy! You're welcome.
